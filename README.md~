# ELEGOO_SmartCar_Hacks

The ELEGOO UNO R3 Project Smart Robot Car Kit V 3.0 Plus is a simple bluetooth enabled Arduino UNO R3 based robot car kit.

We are looking at ways to modify the kit by adding other sensors and behaviors. By default, the ultrasonic sensort is hooked to the same Arduino pins (A4 & A5) that would be used for I2C. By moving these to A2 & A3, we're able to add other I2C devices such as simple 6-axis IMU, color sensors, etc.

We can also add aditional sensors to the open analog pins A0 & A1, such as photoresistors, a GP2Y0A21 IR distance sensor, etc.
